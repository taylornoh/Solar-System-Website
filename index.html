		An Overview of Our Solar System 
	</h1>	
		<p>
			The planetary system we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity - the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf plnets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroid, comets, and meteroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.

		<p>
	       	        There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is named the "solar system" because our Sun is names Sol, after the Latin word for Sun, "solis," and anything related to the Sun we call "solar".
