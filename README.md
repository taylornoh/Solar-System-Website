About Me: 
This project was created for CPSC 254, an "Open Source Software Development". Our team has created a website using Ubuntu,
which we were able to use through VirtualBox. Both Ubuntu and VirtualBox are open-source software that we were able to utilizes for 
our project. Our website is about the Solar System and offers an overview of what it is, fun facts, and an image depicting the different
planets that orbit our Sun. This website is open-source and so is downloadable and modifiable when given credit to the authors listed above.
